- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Speedster1205
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m deeply interested in computer science/software engineering; therfore I am trying to devlop a plethora of useful abilties for the future.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on improving my typing capabilities (90 WPM), in addition to my java, python and C++ skills on Codiva, JGRASP, CodeHS, RoboCode and etc. Furthermore, I recently started working for an organization called MY Voice Canada and at the moment I am learning the language dart on flutter sdk. I am using visual studio code and the andrioid emulator to help make this all possible.
